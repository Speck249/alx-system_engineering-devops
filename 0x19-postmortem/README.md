# Postmortem: Database Lock Incident

**Incident Summary:**
- On July 23, 2023, a database lock incident was experienced which impacted the website functionality and performance, affecting user experience and data consistencies.
* This postmortem aims to provide a detailed incident analysis along with its root cause, the actions taken to resolve it, and recommendations to prevent similar incidents in the future.

**Incident Timeline:**
NOTE - All times are in East African Time(EAT).
- July 23, 2023, 12:34pm: Incident identified - Users reported slow website/application performance and errors.
* July 23, 2023, 12:37pm: Initial investigation initiated - IT Operations team identified the issue as a database lock.
+ July 23, 2023, 12:55pm: Incident escalated to the Database Administration team for further analysis and resolution.
- July 23, 2023  13:17pm: Root cause identified - Concurrent write operations leading to lock contention.
* July 23, 2023  13:23pm: Immediate mitigation actions implemented - Adjusted query optimization, increased database resources, and optimized locking strategy.
+ July 23, 2023  13:51pm: Website performance gradually restored - User reports of slow performance and errors decreased.
- July 23, 2023  14:21pm: Incident resolved - Normal website/application functionality and performance restored.

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the database lock incident was identified as concurrent write operations.
* A high number of transactions attempted to modify the same data simultaneously leading to locks and transaction blocks which caused query delays and resulted in degraded website performance.

**Mitigation and Resolution:** 
The following mitigation and resolution actions were implemented:
1. The Database Administration team optimized the queries involved in the write operations, minimizing their completion time and reducing likelihood of lock contention.
2. Additional resources were allocated to the database system, including increased CPU, memory, and disk I/O capacity.
3. Locking strategy was reviewed and adjusted to ensure a balance between data consistency and concurrency.
4. Enhanced monitoring and alerting mechanisms were implemented to proactively detect and respond to potential lock contention issues.
5. Incident response process was evaluated and refined to ensure effective communication and coordination.

**Preventive Measures and Recommendations:**
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures and recommendations are suggested:
1. Continuously review and optimize database queries to improve overall performance.
2. Conduct thorough testing and load simulations to identify potential similar fault scenarios and address them before they impact production environments.
3. Regularly review locking strategy the database system uses, and ensure it aligns with the application's requirements and workload characteristics.
4. Perform regular capacity planning exercises to ensure sufficient hardware resources are available to handle workload and concurrency demands.
5. Implement robust monitoring and alerting systems to promptly detect and respond to similar issues by allerting relevant personnel.

**Conclusion:**
The database lock incident had a noticeable impact on our website performance and user experience. Through quick detection, a detailed root cause analysis, and the implementation of mitigation steps, we were able to restore normal functionality and performance. By incorporating the preventive measures and recommendations outlined in this postmortem, we aim to strengthen our infrastructure and minimize the occurrence of similar incidents in the future.
