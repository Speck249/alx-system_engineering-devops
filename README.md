# System Engineering and DevOps Course

## Course Description
The ALX Full Stack Engineering Track's first 9 months aims to enable developers build a set of real-world, industry aligned
skills. As the final sprint of the Foundations program, the System Engineering and DevOps course is geared towards developing
foundational understanding in Linux and Unix System Programming, Networking Principles, Web Architecture, and CI / CD. 

This repository contains curriculum focused subject areas broken down into corresponding project topics. Unless referring to Portfolio,
'project' in ALX refers to a compilation of practical tasks that students must complete. Each project contains a thorough guideline to 
navigating each given task, along with general outline of learning objectives and project requirements. The System Engineering and DevOps
projects range from Scripting to Virtual Server configurations as well as Debugging exercises.
